# B-NEM

Boolean Nested effects Models (B-NEM) are used to infer signalling
pathways. In different experiments (conditions) members of a pathway
(S-genes) are stimulated or inhibited, alone and in combination. In
each experiment transcriptional targets (E-genes) of the pathway react
differently and are higher or lower expressed depending on the
condition. From these differential expression B-NEM infers Boolean
functions presented as hyper-edges of a hyper-graph connecting parents
and children in the pathway. For example if the signal is transducted
by two parents A and B to a child C and the signal can be blocked with
a knock- down of either one, they are connected by a typical
AND-gate. If the signal is still transduced during a single
knock-down, but blocked by the double knock-down of A and B, they
activate C by an OR-gate. In general the state of child C is defined
by a Boolean function

f: {0,1}^n -> {0,1}, C = f(A_1, ... , A_n)

with its parents A_i, i âˆˆ {1,...,n}.
